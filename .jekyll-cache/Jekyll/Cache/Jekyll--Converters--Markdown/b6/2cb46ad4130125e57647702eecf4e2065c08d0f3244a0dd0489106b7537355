<p>This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside blog posts.</p>

<p>We’ve included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.</p>

<p><strong>Obviously,</strong>we’ve styled up <em>all the basic</em> text formatting options available in <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown</a>.</p>

<p>You can create lists:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple bulleted lists</li>
  <li>Like this one</li>
  <li>Are cool</li>
</ul>

<p>And:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Numbered lists</li>
  <li>Like this other one</li>
  <li>Are great too</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also add <strong>blockquotes</strong>, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”</p>
